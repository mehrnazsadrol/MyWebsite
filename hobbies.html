									<h3 class="major">My Hobbies</h3> -->
									<p>
										I genuinely enjoy any kind of physical activity. in summer, I usually camp with friends three or four times a month. 
										And over the past three summers that I have been in Manitoba, I can now say I have been to almost all of the famous camp 
										areas of the province. Nature gives me a freeing feeling, and I try to spend as much time as possible outdoors in the four
										 months of summer that we have in Winnipeg. I also hold a small collection of plants in my apartment, and plant markets are 
										 one of my favourite places to go when I feel down or need a little bit of refreshment in my life.<br> 
										I love water! Ocean, river, lake or my residential swimming pool; Swimming makes me deeply happy.
										In winter I go skating and usually spend a considerable amount of time at the gym! 
										Besides all these, my main hobby is my major! I love computer science and everything about it. I love learning new concepts 
										and testing my knowledge and capabilities in web, software and game development. My very last project at work was about making
										 a 3D game in Unity, and I must say I am not lying if I tell you it was FUN! I have spent countless hours learning more about Unity
										  and examining different ways to implement my ideas to find the best one on the internet. My curiosity has always motivated me to search 
										  for new experiences. I am always looking forward to broadening my knowledge and sharpening my skills in the beautifully amazing world of computer science.
