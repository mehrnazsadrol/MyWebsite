								Unlike some people, I am very much an outdoor person and LOVE to spend time hanging out
								with friends and having fun outdoors if Winnipeg's weather allows it
							</p>

								I have been to many camping areas in Manitoba, and my favourite camping spot is Grant
								beach campsite. I love nature, and the green colour of trees makes me feel the oxygen boost in my body. And what makes the Grant
								beach campsite so unique is that each camp site is separated by the condensed tree texture, and it is a very cozy spot if you
								want a small summer weekend getaway.

								My favourite river site in Manitoba is Caddy lake! Every time I go there, I fall in love
								with it even more. Paddleboarding can never	go wrong there, except for the one time that
								 I fell asleep on the board and got lost in	the river XD

								Besides these, I like swimming. Luckily my building has a residential pool, and whenever
								I feel overwhelmed by work or my personal life,	it is my to-go place. It feels exactly 
								like putting water on the fire inside me and calms me down instantly.

								I am not a professional in any of my hobbies, but I always do my best to have some daily
								physical activity to maintain my physical and mental health. <br>
								On days that I am working from home, intentionally or unintentionally, I hit the gym for
								a workout to relieve the day's stress.

							</p>
						</article>

								I also like playing tennis. Admittedly it's not long since I have grown this interest in
								tennis,	but I genuinely enjoy it and would have loved it if we had longer summers here in 
								Winnipeg so that I could play more outdoor. But it is what it is ;)

								Winters in Winnipeg are sadly depressing, but I love skating on the river and find it joyful to watch
								 all those kids and people skating under the moonlight by trees decorated with Christmas lights. 
								I started Cross country skiing this past winter, and I found it pretty challenging and exhausting, but as 
								I did it more often, I got used to it, and I felt less sore the day after ;)

								I don't have a pet, but I love all my friends' pets, and my favourite is Charlie ( he's a black german shepherd). I love cats, but if I were to choose between
								 having a cat or a dog after graduating from school, I would most definitely get a dog. But for now, I only grow plants and have a small collection of apartment plants at home :D
