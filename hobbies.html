										WARNING: this page includes personal information :D So if you are a recruiter and think this is boring, excessive informan,
										 feel free to skip to my resume  (^_^)<br><br>

										 Unlike some people, I am very much an outdoor person and LOVE to spend time hanging out with friends and having fun outdoors if
										  Winnipeg's weather allows it -_^  <br>
										 I have been to many camping areas in Manitoba, and my favourite camping spot is Grant beach campsite. I love nature, and the green
										  colour of trees makes me feel the oxygen boost in my body. And what makes the Grant beach campsite so unique is that each
										  camp site is separated by the condensed tree texture, and it is a very cozy spot if you want a small summer weekend getaway.<br>
										  My favourite river site in Manitoba is Caddy lake! Every time I go there, I fall in love with it even more. Paddleboarding can never 
										  go wrong there, except for the one time that I fell asleep on the board and got lost in the river XD <br> 
										  Besides these, I like swimming. Luckily my building has a residential pool, and whenever I feel overwhelmed by work or my personal life,
										   it is my to-go place. It feels exactly like putting water on the fire inside me and calms me down instantly. <br>
										   I am not a professional in any of my hobbies, but I always do my best to have some daily physical activity to maintain my physical and mental health. <br> 
										   On days that I am working from home, intentionally or unintentionally, I hit the gym for a workout to relieve the day's stress.<br>
										   I also like playing tennis. Admittedly it's not long since I have grown this interest in tennis, but I genuinely enjoy it and would have loved
										    it if we had longer summers here in Winnipeg so that I could play more outdoor. But it is what it is ;) <br>
											Winters in Winnipeg are sadly depressing, but I love skating on the river and find it joyful to watch all those kids and people skating under
											 the moonlight by trees decorated with Christmas lights. <br>

										I genuinely enjoy any kind of physical activity. in summer, I usually camp with friends three or four times a month. 
										And over the past three summers that I have been in Manitoba, I can now say I have been to almost all of the famous camp 
										areas of the province. Nature gives me a freeing feeling, and I try to spend as much time as possible outdoors in the four
										 months of summer that we have in Winnipeg. I also hold a small collection of plants in my apartment, and plant markets are 
										 one of my favourite places to go when I feel down or need a little bit of refreshment in my life.<br> 
										I love water! Ocean, river, lake or my residential swimming pool; Swimming makes me deeply happy.
										In winter I go skating and usually spend a considerable amount of time at the gym! 
										Besides all these, my main hobby is my major! I love computer science and everything about it. I love learning new concepts 
										and testing my knowledge and capabilities in web, software and game development. My very last project at work was about making
										 a 3D game in Unity, and I must say I am not lying if I tell you it was FUN! I have spent countless hours learning more about Unity
										  and examining different ways to implement my ideas to find the best one on the internet. My curiosity has always motivated me to search 
										  for new experiences. I am always looking forward to broadening my knowledge and sharpening my skills in the beautifully amazing world of computer science.
